    <section id="blockchain">
        <h2>Blockchain Technology</h2>
        <p>
            Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. 
            Instead of relying on a single central authority, blockchain uses cryptography and consensus mechanisms 
            to ensure that data is secure, transparent, and immutable. Every transaction is stored in a "block," 
            and these blocks are linked chronologically to form the "chain." 
            This technology underpins cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and many other decentralized applications.

    <section id="crypto-cycle">
        <h2>Crypto & the 4-Year Cycle</h2>
        <p>
            Many analysts believe cryptocurrency markets, especially Bitcoin, follow a 4-year cycle influenced 
            by the Bitcoin halving — an event where the mining reward is cut in half approximately every four years. 
            Historically, these cycles have included a year of rapid growth (bull market), followed by a year of decline 
            (bear market), then gradual recovery and accumulation phases. 
            While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, understanding this cycle can help investors 
            time entries and exits more effectively.

    <section id="metrics">
        <h2>Important Metrics in Crypto</h2>
        <p>
            Key metrics help investors evaluate crypto projects and market trends. 
            Market capitalization shows the total value of a cryptocurrency and helps compare project sizes. 
            Trading volume indicates liquidity and interest. 
            On-chain metrics like active addresses, transaction counts, and hash rate can reveal network health. 
            For long-term analysis, tracking Bitcoin dominance and stablecoin inflows can also offer insights 
            into market sentiment and risk appetite.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section id="risks">
        <h2>Risks & Safety in Crypto</h2>
        <p>
            The crypto market offers exciting opportunities but also carries unique risks. 
            Prices can be highly volatile, and scams such as rug pulls, phishing, and fake tokens are common. 
            To stay safe, always research projects before investing, use trusted exchanges, 
            and store assets in secure wallets (preferably hardware wallets). 
            Never share your private keys or seed phrases — once lost or stolen, they cannot be recovered.
